# Credit Card Score Predication

This machine learning project predicts the credit card score status of applicants based on their financial and personal information.

## 🎯 Project Goal

To build and evaluate models that classify an applicant’s credit card score as **Good**, **Average**, or **Poor** using classification algorithms.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Files used:**
  - `application_record.csv`: Contains applicant demographic and financial info.
  - `credit_record.csv`: Contains historical credit record data for each applicant.
